;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Description:
;;;
;;; Provides the command shell-toggle which toggles between the
;;; shell buffer and whatever buffer you are editing.
;;;
;;; This is done in an "intelligent" way.  Features are:
;;; o Starts a shell if none is existent.
;;; o Minimum distortion of your window configuration.
;;; o When done in the shell-buffer you are returned to the same window
;;;   configuration you had before you toggled to the shell.
;;; o If you desire, you automagically get a "cd" command in the shell to the
;;;   directory where your current buffers file exists; just call
;;;   shell-toggle-cd instead of shell-toggle.
;;; o You can conveniently choose if you want to have the shell in another
;;;   window or in the whole frame.  Just invoke shell-toggle again to get the
;;;   shell in the whole frame.
;;;
;;; This file has been tested under Emacs 20.2.
;;;
;;; This file can be obtained from http://www.docs.uu.se/~mic/emacs.html

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Installation:
;;;
;;; o Place this file in a directory in your 'load-path.
;;; o Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;;   (autoload 'shell-toggle "shell-toggle"
;;;    "Toggles between the shell buffer and whatever buffer you are editing."
;;;    t)
;;;   (autoload 'shell-toggle-cd "shell-toggle"
;;;    "Pops up a shell-buffer and insert a \"cd <file-dir>\" command." t)
;;;   (global-set-key [M-f1] 'shell-toggle)
;;;   (global-set-key [C-f1] 'shell-toggle-cd)
;;; o Restart your Emacs.  To use shell-toggle just hit M-f1 or C-f1
;;;
;;; For a list of user options look in code below.
